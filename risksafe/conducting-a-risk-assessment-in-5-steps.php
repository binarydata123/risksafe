<h3 class="sub-header">Step 1: Define the risk context</h3>
<p><b>Identify where or under what circumstances the risk occurs.</b></p> 
<p>For example:a particular work site, department, work section, retail shop branch or after severe weather.</p>

<h3 class="sub-header">Step 2: Risk identification</h3>
<p><b>Identify risks that are likely to affect the achievement of your business goals.</b></p>
<p>Describe the risk. What can happen? Consider how and why it can happen. What happens if the risk eventuates?</p>
<p>Systematically analyse your systems and processes to identify critical points.</p>
<p>Conduct a review of your records and reports to identify things that have gone wrong in the past.</p>
<p>Brainstorm with your employees or co-workers.</p>
<p>Identify what your business does to control this risk and rate the effectiveness of these.</p>

<h3 class="sub-header">Step 3: Risk assessment</h3>
<p><b>Analyse the likelihood and consequences of each identified risk.</b></p>
<p>What is the likelihood of the risk occurring? What is the consequence of the risk event?</p>
<p>Select the description that best describes the likelihood and consequenceof the risk occurring (with existing control measures in place).</p>

<p>Risk Rating = Consequence Rating x Likelihood Rating</p>
<p>On the risk analysis matrix find the intersection of the likelihood and consequence ratings selected for the risk.</p>

<h3 class="sub-header">Step 4: Control strategies</h3>
<p>Develop cost effective options for treating each risk.</p> 
<p>Determine the best treatment option from the methods below.</p>
<ul style="list-style: none">
	<li>1. Avoid (Discontinue risky activity)</li>
	<li>2. Accept (Retain by informed decision)</li>
	<li>3. Remove (Remove risky activity</li>
	<li>4. Take on Risk to increase opportunity</li>
	<li>5. Change Likelihood</li>
	<li>6. Change Consequence</li>
	<li>7. Share risk with 3rd party (Insurance or Joint Venture)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sub-header">Step 5: Monitoring and review</h3>
<p>Risk management is an ongoing process. Even if the existing control measures are adequate you need to regularly review whether anything has changed which may impact on the risk issues you have identified.</p>
<p>Once the proposed controls are completed reassess the risk by conducting regularrisk reviews, control checksand audits.</p>  
<p>Stay ahead of the competition and thrive in the marketplace!</p>
