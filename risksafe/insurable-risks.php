<p>Insurance is a small part of the whole Risk Management process.  It allows your organisation to receive financial compensation in the case of loss through the operation of your organisation. However, it does not prevent an incident occurring. Insurance should be employed as a “safety net”in case of an incident.  It should be applied as a part of a comprehensive risk management strategy which aims to avoid, reduce and control risks. While it’s important to insure your business against major business risks, your first line of defence should always be risk management.</p> 
<p>Once you identify all of your risks, taking out the right insurance will help protect your business from financial loss and minimise its exposure to certain risks.Risks that could have major consequences but are relatively unlikely to happen are often insurable.</p> 
<p>Then there are the company killers. These risks can sink startups and corporate giants alike. The survival of your venture depends on your ability to identify and mitigate the company killers.</p>
<p>Risk management refers to a broad range of mitigation strategies and insurance is just one of these strategies.</p> 
<p>Here are a few common forms of insurance and the risks they cover:</p>
