<p>Control Self Assessment (CSA) is a management tool designed to assist work teams to be more effective in achieving their objectives and managing their related risks.</p>
<p>CSA is a highly interactive and collaborative process that is designed to focus on processes and issues that are important to a business or organisation.</p>  
<p>The CSA should include the people actually doing the work - not just those managing a process.</p> 
<p>Control measures that have been implemented must be reviewed, and if necessary, revised to make sure they work as planned.</p>
<p>There are certain situations where you must review your control measures, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When the control measure is not effective in controlling the risk e.g. when an incident occurs</li>
	<li>Before a change at the workplace that is likely to give rise to a new or different health and safety risk that the control measure may not effectively control</li>
	<li>If a new hazard or risk is identified</li>
	<li>If the results of consultation indicate that a review is necessary</li>
	<li>If a Health and Safety Representative requests a review</li>
</ul>
